# 16 byte CMOS SRAM

- Designed a 16-byte SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) using the 180nm technology node, employing a full custom approach.
- This SRAM design allows for reading or writing 8-bit data at a time.
- Throughout the project, various Cadence tools were employed to aid in the design and verification processes.
